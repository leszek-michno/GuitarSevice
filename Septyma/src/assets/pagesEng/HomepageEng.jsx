    Regardless of whether playing is your passion, hobby, or profession - your guitar deserves special attention. It is an expression of your style, taste and personality, and also states your personal vision and self-image as a guitarist. 
    <br />
    For many of us, this one or several (dozen) guitars are the apple of our eye. Properly adjusted and cared for, they will serve us for many years, bringing joy and satisfaction from use. As a lover of the art of fiddling with the devil, I approach each instrument with this philosophy, individually adapting and constantly expanding the scope of services in the broad subject of luthiery, in order to meet the imagination and requirements of even the most demanding musicians. 
    <br />
    Septyma Guitars focuses on the quality of implemented projects, accessibility and filling empty spaces on the market of services and goods of the local music scene.
